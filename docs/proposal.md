# CO2 Emission Prediction Project - Proposal

## Project Overview
The **CO2 Emission Prediction Project** aims to analyze historical CO2 emissions data to predict future emissions based on various features such as energy consumption and industrial output. The project will employ machine learning techniques to help forecast emissions, which could be useful for understanding the potential impact of climate change.

## Problem Statement
Predicting future CO2 emissions is a critical issue, as it allows for better planning and policy-making regarding climate change. The project will focus on analyzing historical emissions data and using it to predict future emissions, which can provide valuable insights for governments and organizations aiming to reduce their carbon footprint.

## Goals and Objectives
1. **Data Analysis**: Explore and clean historical CO2 emissions data to gain insights into trends and patterns.
2. **Modeling**: Train a machine learning model to predict future CO2 emissions based on historical data.
3. **Visualization**: Create interactive visualizations using Plotly to illustrate trends and predictions.
4. **Deployment**: Develop a web-based dashboard for users to explore emissions data and make predictions using the trained model.

## Dataset
The project will use historical CO2 emissions data from sources such as:
- World Bankâ€™s World Development Indicators
- Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC)
- Kaggle datasets on global CO2 emissions

The dataset includes CO2 emissions by country, year, and additional factors that could affect emissions such as energy consumption and industrial production.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and model development.
- **Scikit-learn**: For training the machine learning model.
- **Flask**: For developing the web interface and APIs.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **SQLite**: For database storage and retrieval of cleaned data.

## Timeline
1. **Week 1**: Data collection, cleaning, and exploration.
2. **Week 2**: Model training and evaluation.
3. **Week 3**: Build and deploy the web-based dashboard.
4. **Week 4**: Testing, optimization, and final presentation.
